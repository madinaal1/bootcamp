# List is an ordered sequence of items. It is a very flexible data type in python
# The values in a list doesn't have to be of the same type
# items in a list can be modified
# declare a list1 variable and assign values of different datatypes in the list
# items can be accessed based on their index position

emptyList = [] # creates an empty list
print(type(emptyList))
print(emptyList)

# creates a list with elements of different data types
list1 = [1, 5, 9.9, 5, "list", "list"]

# creates a list with elements of different data types
list2 = [1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20]
print("\nThis is a List")
print(type(list1))
print(list1)
print(type(list2))
print(list2)


# Tuple is a sequence of items that are in order
# and it is not possible to modify the tuples. Therefore,
# tuples are faster than list and the primary use of tuples
# is to create, write and protect data
# items can be accessed based on their index position

# declare/create a tuple1 variable and assign values of different datatypes in the tuple
tuple1 = (6, -4, "Tuple", -4, 3.2, "Tuple")
print("\nThis is a Tuple")
print(type(tuple1))
print(tuple1)

# Set is a  collection of unique items that are not in order,
# it is an unordered datatype. Duplicates are eliminated in a set
# Set items cannot be accessed based on their index position

# declare/create a set1 variable and assign values of different datatpes in the set
set1 = {4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 10.5, "xyz", 1.3, 5, "xyz"}
print("\nThis is a Set")
print(type(set1))
print(set1)

# expected output
# duplicate items will be printed only once
# items in the list will be displayed in no particular order

# Dictionary stored data as key value pairs
# to retrieve a specific value from a dictionary you need to know the key

# create a dictionary with key value pairs
dictionary1 = {1: "John", 2: "Anna", 3: "Peter"}
dictionary2 = {"age": 23, "homeOwner": True}
