        <h1>Suki The panda</h1>
        <p>
          Suki was my chocolate lab. She was born in 2007 and I got her in 9th
          grade. She was my favorite puppy ever. She lived a happy life of
          walks, food, and mischeif. She was a sassy diva, a self-entitled brat,
          and loved everyone unconditionally. She passed away in 2020 at the age
          of 13. May she rest in peace. I love you Suki!
